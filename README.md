# AnimePlanet Stats Visualizer
Well i wanted to get some statistics of my different mangas that i have read and since animeplanet dosent really give you any statistics i made some that was easily available. I made it with manga in mind but maybe later on i could make it work with animes also.

If you find this project useful, it would be appreciated if you added the github project somewhere in the bio if you decide to use some of the graphs in your bio.

## Important

If you want to use the same fonts as AnimePlanet uses then you need to install he fonts located in `creteStats/create/fonts.rar`. And well the reason why you need to do it this way is because it seems the "node-canvas" cant seem to be able to use "registerFont" method instead, it's only able to find the font if it's installed on the machine.

## Dependencies

- **npm install canvas**
- **npm install chart.js**
- **npm install chartjs-plugin-datalabels**
- **npm install cheerio**
- **npm install jsdom**
- **npm install puppeteer**
